# Serial Number Transformer

1. **Install Docker Desktop**

   Download and install Docker Desktop for macOS:  
   https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/

2. **Verify Docker Installation**

   Open Terminal and run:

   ```bash
   docker --version
   docker compose version
   ```

   You should see version numbers for both Docker and Docker Compose. If not, Docker Desktop was not installed correctly.

3. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/martinsesitech/serial-number-transformer.git
   cd serial-number-transformer
   ```

4. **Make the Run Script Executable**

   ```bash
   chmod +x run.sh
   ```

5. **First-Time Setup (Build and Run)**

   ```bash
   ./run.sh build
   ```

   This builds the Docker container and starts the CLI program.

6. **Subsequent Runs**

   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

   This skips the build step and runs the program, assuming the container has already been built at least once.
