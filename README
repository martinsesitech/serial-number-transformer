### Step 1: Install Docker Desktop for Mac

1. Download Docker Desktop from [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)


### Step 2: Verify Docker Installation

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

You should see version numbers for both commands.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone or This Project
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd serial-number

### Step 2: Make Scripts Executable

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
```

## Usage

### First Time

```bash
./run.sh build   #build + run
```

This will:
- Build the Docker image
- Start the interactive CLI

### Subsequent Runs

```bash
./run.sh build   #run
```

This is faster as it skips the build step.

### Manual Commands

If you prefer not to use scripts:

```bash
# Build the image
docker compose build

# Run the program
docker compose run --rm serial-transformer
```
